# API Gateway Final Fix - Regex Pattern Matching

## 🐛 **Root Cause Identified**

The debug logs revealed the exact issue:

```
DEBUG: Converted regex: '/api/restaurants/\[\^/\]\+/reviews'
```

The problem was that the square brackets `[` and `]` in the regex `[^/]+` were being escaped, which broke the pattern matching.

## ✅ **Solution Applied**

### **The Fix**
Removed the escaping of square brackets `[` and `]` from the regex conversion process:

```java
// BEFORE (Broken)
.replace("[", "\\[")
.replace("]", "\\]");

// AFTER (Fixed)
// Removed these lines - square brackets should NOT be escaped
```

### **Why This Works**
- Path variables `{restaurantId}` convert to `[^/]+` (match any characters except `/`)
- Square brackets `[` and `]` are essential for the regex character class `[^/]`
- Escaping them breaks the regex pattern

## 🧪 **Expected Results**

### **Before Fix**
```
Pattern: /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/reviews
Regex: /api/restaurants/\[\^/\]\+/reviews  ❌ (Broken)
Match: /api/restaurants/4/reviews → false
```

### **After Fix**
```
Pattern: /api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/reviews
Regex: /api/restaurants/[^/]+/reviews  ✅ (Working)
Match: /api/restaurants/4/reviews → true
```

## 🚀 **Testing the Fix**

1. **Restart the API Gateway service**
2. **Test the endpoint**:
   ```bash
   POST http://localhost:8080/api/restaurants/4/reviews
   Authorization: Bearer <your_customer_token>
   ```
3. **Check the debug logs** - you should now see:
   ```
   DEBUG: Converted regex: '/api/restaurants/[^/]+/reviews'
   DEBUG: Pattern match result: true
   ```

## ✅ **What This Fixes**

- ✅ Pattern matching now works correctly
- ✅ Path variables `{restaurantId}` match actual paths like `/api/restaurants/4/reviews`
- ✅ Role-based authorization will work
- ✅ Customer tokens will be accepted for restaurant reviews
- ✅ No more 403 "Access denied" errors

## 🔍 **Debug Log Analysis**

The fix ensures that:
1. **Pattern**: `/api/restaurants/{restaurantId}/reviews`
2. **Converts to**: `/api/restaurants/[^/]+/reviews` (not `\[\^/\]\+`)
3. **Matches**: `/api/restaurants/4/reviews` → `true`
4. **Authorization**: CUSTOMER role is allowed → `true`

## 🎯 **Key Insight**

The issue was that we were being too aggressive with regex escaping. Square brackets are essential for character classes in regex, so they should NOT be escaped when they're part of a valid regex pattern like `[^/]+`.

This fix ensures that all path variables will work correctly with proper pattern matching and role-based authorization.
